# Introduction
This is a Flask web application that uses the OpenAI API to create a chatbot. The chatbot interacts with users and provides therapy-like conversation in response to prompts from the user. The chat history is stored in a JSON file and is loaded and saved to allow for continuous conversations with the chatbot.
